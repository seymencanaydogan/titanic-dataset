# 🚢 Titanic Dataset Analysis & Machine Learning

This project focuses on **data analysis and machine learning** using the famous **Titanic dataset**.
The goal is to explore the dataset, perform data preprocessing, analyze important features, and build predictive models to estimate passenger survival.

The entire workflow is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook** for clarity and reproducibility.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

* Understand the structure of the Titanic dataset
* Clean and preprocess missing and inconsistent data
* Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
* Identify key features affecting survival
* Build and evaluate machine learning models

---

## 📊 Dataset Information

The Titanic dataset contains passenger information such as:

* Passenger class (Pclass)
* Sex
* Age
* Number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp)
* Number of parents/children aboard (Parch)
* Ticket fare
* Port of embarkation
* Survival status (target variable)

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook includes:

* Statistical summaries of features
* Handling missing values (e.g., Age, Cabin)
* Visualization of survival rates by:

  * Gender
  * Passenger class
  * Age groups
  * Fare distribution

EDA helps uncover patterns and relationships that influence survival probability.
